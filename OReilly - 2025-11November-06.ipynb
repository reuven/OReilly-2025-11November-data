    "# What is data science?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a huge, new term in the last decade or two. I divide into several parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All of data science is everything having to do with retrieving, analyzing, and forecasting with data. It's the overall umbrella term.\n",
    "- *Data analytics* is making sense of data that we've already collected. That's what we're going to be doing in this course.\n",
    "- *Data engineering* is about getting data from one place to another, so that we can analyze it.\n",
    "- *Modeling* and *machine learning* is about making predictions, or forecasts, based on existing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example, if I'm a big company:\n",
    "- My data engineers will move data from our various databases into a central location so that we can analyze it\n",
    "- The data analysts will look it over and understand how many widgets we sold last year, and in which regions, and which salespeople did the best job.\n",
    "- The ML specialists will use the data to predict how well we'll sell our widgets next year, and which regions and types of customers we should target.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these disciplines now use Python as their main language of choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "That seems **SUPER WEIRD** if you know anything about Python. Python doesn't run quickly and uses lots of memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest reason that Python is the #1 language for data science is NumPy -- which gives us the speed and size of C data, but with a Python layer over it. That makes it easy to work with but also very efficient. NumPy has long been favored by scientists and engineers for working with data. There's even a SciPy package which has lots of libraries for various scientific and engineering fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of the reason NumPy works so well is that it's *vectorized*, meaning that don't work with individual data points, but rather we work with groups of numbers. NumPy is optimized to do things in that sort of way.\n",
    "\n",
    "I could use NumPy for everything! But it's a bit low level for many people's tastes.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's where Pandas comes in: Pandas is a wrapper around NumPy that provides a ton of additional functionality. Using a Pandas series is very similar to using a NumPy array, but you have hundreds of additional methods. Also, you can work with many more data types (e.g., dates and times, and also strings), and you can work with many different file types and formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas has been around for about 17 years now, and it continues to be really, really popular -- about 40m downloads every month.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lots of organizations are moving from Matlab, R, or Excel to use Pandas instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many ways, you can think of Pandas as providing all of the functionality of Excel, but inside of Python. This means that you can perform all of those calculations, but you'll do it without needing to sit in front of your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no way to remember all of the Pandas functionality! My goal is to teach you how think the way that Pandas wants you to think, and thus be able to find and understand the right documentation to do what you want."
